In this lab, we used what we learned from lecture about PID control and implemented it to our car. We first had to set up the bluetooth connection and make sure that the Artemis and laptop could communicate information smoothly so that the laptop can use the information from the sensors to make necessary adjustments, and send that information back to the Artemis and so on.
