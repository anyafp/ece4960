In this lab, we characterized our car to leverage the remote control and familiarize ourselves with the capabilities of the hardware. This is in hopes of replicating the manual behavior with autonomous control (and maybe exceed what manual control can do). We did some tests and took measurements in 2 different categories below.

# Prelab

# Category A Measurements

__What are the dimensions of the car?__

__What is the weight?__

__How long does it take to charge?__

__What is the battery life time?__

# Category B Measurements

__What is the range of speed?__
* This is battery dependent
* Consider using the ToF sensors to help you measure this

__What is the range of acceleration?__
* Consider using the ToF sensors and/or the IMU to help you measure this

__What is the braking distance?__
* Consider using the ToF sensors and/or the IMU to help you measure this

__What surfaces can it handle? Can you register the difference between surfaces using the sensors?__

__What stunts can it do?__
* Be sure to note the sequence of commands that corresponds with each stunt

__How reliably does the robot turn around its own axis?__

__How well can you operate the car with manual control?__
* e.g. Starting from ~5m distance, at full speed, how close can you get to a wall and stop the car, without a crash?
* e.g. How accurately can you hit four corners for a meter-scale square as fast as possible?
* e.g. Can you reliably reproduce trcks? (Describe which and what control inputs you give it)
* e.g. Can you make the robot balance on one set of wheels (front or back)?
