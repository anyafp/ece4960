In this lab, we were given a fully-functional and optimized Bayes filter that works on the virtual robot, and we want to see if it works as well on the real robot

# Lab Task

## Localization (Sim)

Since we were given the model code for the Bayes filter, we want to run that and test it out on the simulator first before doing anything with the actual robot just to make sure.

The belief (blue plots) are not too far off from the ground truth (green plot), so we're good to go to the next step.

## Observation Loop

The observation loop is similar to that of [Lab 9](https://anyafp.github.io/ece4960/labs/lab9/){:target="_blank"}'s (Mapping), so I reused that code. The only difference is, because I used continuous rotation and sampled as frequently as I wanted to, I needed to change the sampling such that I only stored the sensor data every 20ยบ. At first I was going to rewrite my code to implement the rotation that would stop at every 20ยบ and get the sensor reading, but thanks to [Ben](https://bwagner2-git.github.io/){:target="_blank"}'s advice, I just used the same code and set the robot to sample when the theta angle reached 20ยบ increments.

One caveat to this (brought up by [Jojo](https://jojoliangs.github.io/ECE4960_FastRobots/){:target="_blank"}) is that, if the robot was rotating too quickly, the sensor reading measured might not be at the angle that we had recorded as the sampling time is about 15ms. I think that my rotation was slow enough to overcome this problem, but I wanted to look at my results to see whether it was worth to go back and change my code.

## Localization (Real)

When we do the real localization with the robot, we only use the update step which uses the sensor model. Because of this, we only need to get the sensor data at a certain positions in the map (namely the ones that we had used in [Lab 9](https://anyafp.github.io/ece4960/labs/lab9/){:target="_blank"}) which were, in feet:

* (-3,-2)
* (0,3)
* (5,-3)
* (5,3)

Instead of integrating my [Lab 9](https://anyafp.github.io/ece4960/labs/lab9/){:target="_blank"} code into this lab's jupyter notebook, I ran Lab 9's code for each coordinate, extracted the data, and manually hardcoded it as the values to be used in this lab. What I should have instead done was spent the time to integrate the code into this lab's notebook so that everything could be sent via bluetooth with one run. However, the way I went about it is better for debugging in case I did something wrong with the integration.

### Good Beliefs

I had 2 good belief points which were at (-3,-2) and (5,-3).

I manually plotted the ground truth of (-3,-2) and (5,-3) but in meters, and this is not seen in the figures because they are plotted right under the belief data point.

### Not So Good Beliefs

I had 2 not so good belief points which were at (0,3) and (5,3). In order to analyze how far the belief points actually were from the ground truth, I turned on the black and white grids to look at the grid squares.

#### (0,3)

<p align="left"><img src="../../images/lab12/bel-bad-03.png" height="1500" width="1500"></p>

For this coordinate, the belief is one (diagonal) grid away.

#### (5,3)

<p align="left"><img src="../../images/lab12/bel-bad-53.png" height="1500" width="1500"></p>

For this coordinate, the belief is one grid away. 

One reason why these two coordinated may have been less successful with their localization may be because (0,3) and (5,3) were the coordinates that I localized first. This may have affected the rotation of the robot when it gathered the sensor readings as the wheels may not have caught as much dust (and hence had more friction) which made the rotation less smooth and hence drifted more, making the robot believe it was at the other grid location and not the actual one.
